# coralnet
These scripts are a Frankenstein's monster made from the great work by SMiller and JordanMakesMaps, who have both created excellent documentation. 

There are some original peices that helped me to understand how to process CoralNet's output, and I added a new function that allows me to feed the robot multiple images at once.

There are identical Jupyter Notebook and .py files available--I believe the notebook files may be easier to read and execute 
because so much of these needs to be bespoke per the user.
